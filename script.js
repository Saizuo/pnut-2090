const PNUT_BACKSTORY = `
Peanut (2017 ‚Äì October 30, 2024), also known as PNut, was a male eastern gray squirrel. Found and rescued by Mark Longo in 2017, he was the subject of a popular Instagram account. On October 30, 2024, he was seized from his owner‚Äôs home by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and euthanized soon after. Peanut‚Äôs death triggered outcry on social media, condemnation from lawmakers, and the introduction of a bill aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future.

Peanut was rescued in 2017 by Mark Longo after the squirrel‚Äôs mother was killed by a car in New York City. Longo sought a shelter for Peanut but was unsuccessful, so he bottle-fed the squirrel for eight months before deciding Peanut should be returned to the wild. However, a day later, Peanut returned to Longo‚Äôs porch with half of his tail missing. Longo said, ‚ÄúI opened the door, Peanut ran inside, and that was the end of Peanut‚Äôs wildlife career.‚Äù

It is illegal to keep squirrels as pets in New York. For seven years, Peanut stayed in Longo‚Äôs care in Norwalk, Connecticut, without a license. Longo later stated he was in the process of filing paperwork to certify Peanut as an educational animal at the time of the seizure but did not explain why he did not pursue a license in the preceding years.

In January 2024, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began investigating Longo after receiving complaints from licensed wildlife rehabilitators alleging he was keeping wildlife illegally. Following the initial complaint, Longo was warned that owning Peanut was illegal, to which Longo responded that the animal had been released into the wild. Investigators reviewed Longo‚Äôs social media accounts and found evidence Peanut was still in his care, along with a raccoon.

On October 19, 2024, the Chemung County Health Department received a complaint regarding Longo‚Äôs unlicensed animals and forwarded it to the NYSDEC. By October 22, the NYSDEC confirmed that Longo was keeping at least one squirrel and four raccoons on his property illegally. On October 30, 2024, Peanut and a raccoon named Fred were seized from Longo‚Äôs home in Pine City, New York. Social media posts were the basis for the search warrant. 

Two days later, officials alleged Peanut bit one of the personnel involved, and the animals were euthanized to test for rabies. While squirrels rarely carry rabies, the decision was made because Peanut had cohabitated with a raccoon, which is a common rabies vector. On November 12, officials announced that Peanut and Fred had tested negative for rabies. Despite the outcry, the seizure and euthanasia followed standard protocols.

Longo criticized the NYSDEC for excessive force during the raid, which he claimed lasted five hours. In a press conference, officials stated they were unaware of Peanut‚Äôs internet presence, though it would not have affected the outcome.
